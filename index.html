                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>The Architecture of Bittensor</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Bittensor's architecture is built on a combination of blockchain technology and machine learning principles. Here’s a breakdown of its core components:<br><br><strong>1. Network Structure</strong><br>Bittensor operates as a decentralized network of nodes, where each node represents an individual or organization contributing to the training of AI models. These nodes can be thought of as "neurons" in the brain, working together to enhance the overall intelligence of the network.<br><br><strong>2. Proof of Intelligence</strong><br>At the heart of Bittensor's protocol is a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof of Intelligence. This mechanism rewards nodes based on the quality and utility of their contributions to the network. Instead of relying solely on computational power, Bittensor evaluates the performance and effectiveness of the AI models shared by each node.<br><br><strong>3. Tokenomics</strong><br>Bittensor utilizes a native cryptocurrency, TAO, to facilitate transactions within the network. Participants earn TAO tokens by contributing their models, computational resources, and data. These tokens can then be used for various purposes, including staking, governance, and accessing premium features on the platform.<br><br><strong>4. Model Training and Sharing</strong><br>Bittensor enables users to train machine learning models using decentralized datasets. Once trained, models can be shared with the network, allowing other participants to leverage them for their applications. This collaborative approach not only speeds up the development process but also enhances the overall quality of AI models available in the ecosystem.</p>
